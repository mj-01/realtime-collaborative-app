# 🔌 Socket.IO Implementation Complete!

## ✅ Backend Socket.IO Event Handlers

### **Connection Events**
- **`connect`** - Handle client connection, send welcome message
- **`disconnect`** - Handle client disconnection, trigger user_left event

### **Whiteboard Events**
- **`drawing`** - Handle drawing events with types: 'start', 'draw', 'end'
  - Receives: `{type, strokeId, point?, color?, width?}`
  - Broadcasts to all other clients (excluding sender)
- **`draw`** - Handle individual draw events (alternative)
- **`clear`** - Handle clear canvas events
  - Broadcasts clear command to all other clients

### **Chat Events**
- **`join_chat`** - Handle user joining chat
  - Receives: `{userId, userName}`
  - Saves user info to session
  - Saves join event to Firestore
  - Sends recent messages to new user
  - Broadcasts `user_joined` to all clients
- **`chat_message`** - Handle chat messages
  - Receives: `{id, type, content, sender, timestamp, fileName?, fileSize?, fileType?, downloadUrl?, fileId?}`
  - Saves message to Firestore
  - Broadcasts message to all clients
- **`user_left`** - Handle user leaving chat
  - Saves leave event to Firestore
  - Broadcasts `user_left` to all clients

## ✅ Frontend Socket.IO Integration

### **Chat Component (`Chat.tsx`)**
- **Connection**: Connects to backend using `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`
- **Events Emitted**:
  - `join_chat` - On connect with user info
  - `chat_message` - When sending text or file messages
- **Events Listened**:
  - `chat_message` - Receive new messages
  - `user_joined` - User presence updates
  - `user_left` - User presence updates
  - `recent_messages` - Initial chat history
- **File Upload**: POST to `/upload` endpoint, then emit `chat_message`

### **Whiteboard Component (`Whiteboard.tsx`)**
- **Connection**: Connects to backend using `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`
- **Events Emitted**:
  - `drawing` - Drawing events with types: 'start', 'draw', 'end'
  - `clear` - Clear canvas command
- **Events Listened**:
  - `drawing` - Receive drawing events from other users
  - `clear` - Receive clear commands from other users

## 🔧 Configuration

### **CORS Settings**
```python
# Backend CORS
allow_origins=[
    "http://localhost:3000",  # Local development
    "https://frontend-987275518911.us-central1.run.app",  # Frontend Cloud Run URL
]

# Socket.IO CORS
cors_allowed_origins=[
    "http://localhost:3000",  # Local development
    "https://frontend-987275518911.us-central1.run.app",  # Frontend Cloud Run URL
]
```

### **Environment Variables**
- **Frontend**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://backend-987275518911.us-central1.run.app`
- **Backend**: Uses environment variables for Firestore and Cloud Storage

## 📡 Event Flow

### **Whiteboard Drawing Flow**
1. User starts drawing → Frontend emits `drawing` with type 'start'
2. User continues drawing → Frontend emits `drawing` with type 'draw'
3. User stops drawing → Frontend emits `drawing` with type 'end'
4. Backend receives each event → Broadcasts to all other clients
5. Other clients receive events → Render strokes in real-time

### **Chat Message Flow**
1. User sends message → Frontend emits `chat_message`
2. Backend receives message → Saves to Firestore
3. Backend broadcasts message → All clients receive and display
4. File uploads → POST to `/upload` → Emit `chat_message` with file info

### **User Presence Flow**
1. User connects → Frontend emits `join_chat`
2. Backend saves user info → Broadcasts `user_joined`
3. User disconnects → Backend triggers `user_left`
4. All clients update user list and show presence

## 🧪 Testing

### **Real-time Features**
- **Whiteboard**: Open multiple browser tabs to see collaborative drawing
- **Chat**: Send messages and see them appear in all tabs
- **File Upload**: Upload files and see previews in all tabs
- **Presence**: See user join/leave notifications

### **URLs**
- **Frontend**: `https://frontend-987275518911.us-central1.run.app`
- **Backend**: `https://backend-987275518911.us-central1.run.app`

## 🔐 Security

- **CORS** properly configured for production URLs
- **File Upload** with size limits (10MB max)
- **Signed URLs** for secure file access
- **Session Management** for user tracking

## 📊 Data Persistence

### **Firestore Collections**
- **`messages`** - Chat messages with metadata
- **`chat_events`** - User join/leave events
- **`uploaded_files`** - File metadata and signed URLs

### **Cloud Storage**
- **Bucket**: `labs-realtime-app-files`
- **Files**: Unique filenames with original metadata
- **Access**: Signed URLs with 1-hour expiration
